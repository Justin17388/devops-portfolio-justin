# Justin Shinn — DevOps Portfolio


Hands‑on projects showing practical DevOps skills across Docker, CI/CD, IaC (Terraform), and Kubernetes. Each project is meant to highlight clear READMEs, testing abilities, and use of automations.

## Projects


1. **Docker + Flask Hello** — containerize a tiny Flask app, add tests, and ship to GHCR with GitHub Actions.
2. **Terraform S3 Static Site** — provision an AWS S3 website + public bucket policy + (optional) CloudFront.
3. **Reusable GitHub Actions** — DRY pipelines via composite/reusable workflows.
4. **Kubernetes on kind** — deploy the Flask app to a local kind cluster with Kustomize and add basic metrics.
