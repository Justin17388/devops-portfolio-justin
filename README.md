Real-world containerized apps, infrastructure as code, and multi-cloud deployment workflows.

| Project | Focus | What it shows |
|--------|-------|----------------|
| **Docker + Flask Hello** | Docker, GitHub Actions, testing | Containerizing a Python app, pushing image to registry, automated CI |
| **Terraform S3 Static Site** | Terraform, AWS S3 | Provisioning AWS infrastructure with IaC, remote backend/state discipline |

## Private Projects (available upon request)

I am currently developing a production-ready web application deployed on DigitalOcean using:

- Dockerized backend services  
- HTTPS certificates via Nginx + Certbot  
- Automated deployment pipelines  
- Cloud-native architecture with secure configuration  

Details are private until the project is fully complete, but I can discuss the architecture and implementation in an interview.

## Projects

1. **Docker + Flask Hello** — containerize a tiny Flask app, add tests, and ship to GHCR with GitHub Actions.  
2. **Terraform S3 Static Site** — provision an AWS S3 website + public bucket policy (+ optional CloudFront).  
3. **Reusable GitHub Actions** — workflow that runs ansible-lint on PRs and can optionally deploy on demand.  
4. **Kubernetes on kind** — deploy the Flask app to a local kind cluster with Kustomize and add basic metrics.
